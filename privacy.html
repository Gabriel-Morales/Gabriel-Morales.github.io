<h1>
Privacy Policy
</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my basic privacy policy. Privacy is a fundamental part of the apps I create;
<br>
currently all of my applications do not collect any user data with my knowledge or purposeful implementation. 
<br>I use only native APIs on a per-platform basis unless otherwise, and explicitly, stated.
<br>The apps I create have the sole purpose of being "cool" in nature and hopefully pleasant to use.
<br>Also, these apps are a hobby for me to learn and use different technologies! 
<br>For these reasons, I also avoid including any advertisements.
