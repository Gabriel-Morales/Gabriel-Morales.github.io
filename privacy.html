<h1>
Privacy Policy
</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my basic privacy policy regarding the applications I create. I will always consider the privacy of the users for the apps that I create. 
<br>
User data will not be stored or collected by me with my knowledge or purposeful implementation. 
  Certain cases may arise where specific data is used for specific functionality - for example speech transcription when on-device is not possible; 
  although I will always make it clear that this is the case, these are instances where I am not able to change this until the API itself chanegs. In such and all instances, the feature(s) will be toggle-able. 
<br>I plan to mainly utilize native APIs on a per-platform basis unless otherwise, and explicitly, stated. 
  That is to say, I will make every effort not to use a third-party service for functionalities. 
  In regards to any use of non-native APIs and libraries, their use will be limited to open-source and publicly-available repositories.<br>
  All open-source repositories and libraries will be listed within the respective app (or settings app, for example) in a dedicated section.
</p>
  <br>
    <p>
      Since I like to be very specific, all of my applications, if using third party services, libraries or APIs will state that they do, why and for what.
      Remember that my goal as a student and hobbyist is to make pleasant and cool applications to learn the technologies.

  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <b>
  <p>
    Q: Do you incorporate, or will you plan on incorporating machine learning (ML)? 
  </p>
  </b>
  <br>
  <p>
    A: ML is a very cool thing. Yes, I will plan on using it in my apps, but I will always use on-device machine learning where possible. 
    <br>If on-device ML is not possible, I will use only the native APIs of the platform that I'm developing for.
    <br>As an aside, at the moment, I do not plan on using any Generative LLM technology.
